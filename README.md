# Relative Import

This adds a button to the Explorer (workspace file tree) that allows you to copy the relative path diff

1. Open a file
2. Right click on a file in the tree and select `Copy Relative Path Diff`

Example:

> You want to import this component into webpage.js

The component you want to import:

`/home/username/project2/subproject2.1/javascript/ts/reusable/ui/component.js`

The location of the webpage you have currently open:

`/home/username/project1/subproject1.1/javascript/ts/webpage.js`

The relative path you have to use because of some restriction:

../../../../project2/subproject2.1/javascript/ts/reusable/ui/component.js
